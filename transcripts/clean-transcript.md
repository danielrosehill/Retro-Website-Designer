# Retro Website Designer AI Project - Clean Transcript

**Recorded:** December 2025

---

I've been working hard on some serious AI utilities lately for doing important but kind of boring stuff, repository manager and a backup utility. You know, lots of fun in that, if you can do some stupid ridiculous things with AI, too.

Here is the plan for this particular experiment. It is intended mostly for pranking, and you know, for kind of stuff that I guess nerdy people get a laugh out of.

## Idea: Website Rebuild for an "Emerging Internet Look"

My idea is to create an agent who can either do one of two things: build or makeover websites to give them an emerging internet look. I can actually almost remember these websites firsthand, as I'm old enough to live through I guess the dawn of the Internet. I was asking Chat GPT can it give me an example of the first websites, a screenshot. It was too old. It wouldn't be funny to create it because it's so boring.

To get that kind of comical look from Yahoo and GeoCities, the golden era of that aesthetic is 1994. I'm just seeing yeah, 1994 to 1997. Older than that, it's like very, very frontier users, mostly academic users, and therefore, the designs are kind of a bit boring.

So I think it would be, so for my AI agent, knowing how to get these things working, I want to create a few examples, a few reference websites. I'm going to take screenshots and add them in.

We could have one option whereby it's like, do you want the 1990s? Do you want the GeoCities look or do you want even older? I'm looking at an example of Netscape. I actually, these interfaces, it must be triggering some kind of childhood memory or something because I do actually recognize that. I would say to a modern user, it's not even recognizable as a website, so I don't think that one is quite as funny. I think I think Yahoo.

So I think a few visual examples. The other thing that I thought to add to this, I believe in doing pranks thoroughly and well. You can't do a half prank. So if the AI agent is going to have the aesthetic, it needs to also have the cultural context.

## Emulating Cultural Context: Copy Style, Imagery and Spam

Certain things, I'm going to look at a couple of examples. Looking at the first CERN website that they put up, the websites are not only a reflection of the kind of basic UI of the day, the CSS, but you also read things, the copy is also quite distinctive. It'll say, "Click on this hyperlink to open this," or "Welcome to the World Wide Web Portal." So there are these little touches that are fantastic which would take it up another notch in capturing these designs.

I'm pretty confident that they could be reliably and replicably generated by an agent. I'm trying to think if there's any last any last flourishes that would that would make the configuration actually work.

My goal is to say, take something. I could even create a vintage version of my own websites which is an astro build. So here's a folder. Copy it, and then give me that GeoCities look.

At the advanced, there's only so there is a limit to how far I want to actually, it's kind of a very short prank experiment to just make this and maybe use it in the future. The far extensions, I'm trying to think of anything else I'm missing.

I don't want to do time references, saying the copy should, I think it's, I think the best way to do this is to have a dictionary of words to include: hyperlink, World Wide Web, portal, because it has to reflect the style.

I guess there was no spam filtering back in those days. I'll have to look at a few more examples to see what the, if, if contact forms were a thing or if it would be more more fitting and comical to say here's our electronic email box. And then ask people to send an electronic email with a subject line.

I think those touches would really take it from prank level to actually being able to reliably create totally antiquated websites with modern content for projects. Then to be able to do that. I'm assuming these can be deployed through static site frameworks. I think where I might use it is I wanted to do one for my cloud code experiments. Computer scientists have a tendency to create the most delightfully ironic tendency to create the most backward-looking websites. So I'm thinking that this might be a project for it, my first test project. So Daniel's cloud code project and just then get that GeoCities theme. They also they also tended to be crammed full of banner advertisements, I'm noticing, and low-resolution imagery, pixelated imagery. I could have a few fake generate a few fake banner ads with a kind of very 90s theme to inject for added realism.

That is the plan and vision for Retro Website Designer V1 coming soon.
