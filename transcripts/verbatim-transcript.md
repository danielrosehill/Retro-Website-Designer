# Retro Website Designer AI Project - Verbatim Transcript

**Recorded:** December 2025

I've been working hard on some, uh, you know, serious AI utilities lately for, uh, doing, um, important but kind of boring stuff like, uh, repository manager and a backup utility. Uh, you know, lots of fun in that if you can't do some stupid, ridiculous things with AI too. So here's here is the plan for this, uh, this particular, uh, experiment. It is intended mostly for pranking and, you know, for kind of stuff that, uh, I guess nerdy people like me get a laugh out of. What my idea is to, um, create an agent who can either do one of two things: build or make over websites to give them a emerging internet look. Um, I can actually almost remember these websites firsthand as I'm old enough to live through, I guess the dawn of the internet. And I was asking ChatGPT, um, can I give me an example of the first websites? A screenshot or and it was too, it was too old. Like, it wouldn't be funny to create it because it's so boring. To get that kind of comical look from, yeah, from Yahoo and GeoCities, the golden era of that aesthetic is the 1994, I'm just seeing these, yeah, 1994 to 1997. Older than that, it's like very, very frontier users, mostly academic users, and therefore, the designs are kind of a bit boring. Um, so I think it would be, so for my AI agent, knowing knowing how to get these things working, I want to create a few examples, a few reference websites. I'm going to take screenshots, um, and add them in. We could have one option whereby it's like, do you want the 1990s? Do you want the GeoCities look, or do you want the even older? I'm looking at an example of Netscape. And I actually, these interfaces, it must be triggering some kind of a childhood memory or something, because I do actually recognize that. I would say to a modern user, it's not even recognizable as a website. So, I don't think that one is quite as funny. I think it, I think Yahoo So, I think a few visual examples, and the other thing that I, that I thought to add to this, I believe in doing prank thoroughly and well. You can't do a half prank. So, if the AI agent is going to have the aesthetic, it needs to also have the cultural context. So, certain things, I'm going to look at a couple of examples, I'm looking at the first CERN website that they put up, the websites are not only a reflection of the kind of basic, uh, UI of the day, the CSS, but they, you also read things and, like, and the copy is also quite distinctive. It'll say, like, click on this hyperlink to open this, or, like, welcome to the Worldwide Web portal. So, there are these little touches that are fantastic, um, which, which would, which would take it up another notch in, uh, in capturing these these designs. I, I'm pretty confident that they could be reliably and replicably generated by an agent. I'm trying to think if there's any last any last flourishes that would, that would make the configuration actually work. Um, like, my goal is to say take something. I could even create, like, a vintage version of my own website, uh, which is an Astro build. So,, like, here's a folder, copy it, and then, like, give me that GeoCities look. Um, at the advanced, there's only so, there is limited to how far, um, I want to actually, like, it's kind of a very short prank experiment to just make this and maybe use it in the future. Um, the the the far extensions, I'm trying to think of anything else I'm missing. I don't want to do, uh, time references, like saying, uh, the copy should, I think it's, I think the best way to do this is to have a dictionary of words to include. Hyperlink, Worldwide Web, portal, um, because it has to, like, reflect the reflect the style. Um, I guess there was no spam filtering back in those days. I'll have to look at, like, a few more examples to see what the, like, if if contact forms were a thing, or if it would be more more, uh, fitting and comical to, like, say here is our electronic emo box, um, you know, and then ask people to send an electronic email with the subject line. I think those touches would, w- would really take it from kind of prank, like, low low quality prank level, to actually being able to reliably create totally antiquated websites with modern content for projects. And then to be able to do that, like, I, I, I'm assuming these can be deployed through static site frameworks. I think where I might use it is I wanted to do one for my cloud code experiments, and, uh, computer scientists have a tendency to create the most, a deliciously ironic tendency to create the most backward looking websites. So, I'm thinking that this might be a project for it, my first test project. So, like, Daniel's cloud code project, and just then get that GeoCities theme. They're also, they also tended to be crammed full of banner advertisements, I'm noticing. Um, and low resolution imagery and pixelated imagery. I could have, like, a few fake, generate a few fake, uh, banner ads, um, with a kind of very 90s theme to, to inject for added realism. That is the plan and vision for Retro Website Designer V1 coming soon.
