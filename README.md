# Retro Website Designer

**Status:** Placeholder repository

An AI agent that transforms modern websites into authentic 1990s-era designs, complete with GeoCities aesthetics, period-appropriate copy ("Click on this hyperlink!", "Welcome to the World Wide Web Portal"), fake banner ads, and pixelated imagery.

The tool itself will feature a retro pixel art UI, fitting the niche of nostalgic web design tools.

Target era: 1994-1997 (the golden age of Yahoo and GeoCities).
